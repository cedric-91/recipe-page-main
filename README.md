## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwindcss
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Using the utilities classes such as (Tailwindcss) definetley speeds up your development, and not having to come up
with class names is it breath of fresh air. There's definetley a slight learning curve, but got used to it
after some time (trail/error).

The downside is, I found myrself writing the same classes each time on a number of sections on this page. Maybe, because
I'm not using frameworks and just pure HTML.

### Continued development

Will for sure continue adopting Tailwindcss, into my future projects. I see the benefits of using it and it's definetley a learning shift
of not writing your custom css.

### Useful resources

- [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) - Was definetley going back and forward on this website, mainly for colours and fonts and utitilies classes
